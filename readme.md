# Proxi

Proxi (**Prox**y **I**nterface) is a light-weight library that offers a common interface for generating proxies at runtime (aka dynamic proxies). Making possible for developers to leverage runtime proxy generation without having to couple their frameworks, libraries or applications to an specific implementation.
